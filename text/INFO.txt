This template was created for personal use. You may tweak it as you like.
Normally it should be located under
~/.local/share/kdevappwizard/templates/Cpp_CMake.

3/7/2016: I updated it, in order to be able to work with regex.

20/2/2017: Updated the inner CMakeList.txt in order to build shared libs if the user needs to.
Just uncomment what is needed and append the names that correspond to your libraries source files.

March - 2017: Fixed a typo in a CMakeList.txt and give the ability to use <> for including as well.
CMakeList.txt now uses include_directories( ${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/src/headers ) in order to find the .h files

Use add_library() in order to *create* one from your code.
Use target_link_libraries( logcat_symbolizer somelib) in order to link your code to an external library.
example (let's say you need BOOST) : target_link_libraries( logcat_symbolizer ${Boost_LIBRARIES} )
---

"headers" directory should contain any additional header you may write for consistency.
"src" directory should contain any .cc or .cpp file you may write for consistency.
*You have to edit* CMakeList.txt and add these files with their respective
directory.

Example how your project shoulde be structured:
HEADERS:
#{PROJECTFOLDER}/src/headers/blahblah.h

SRC:
#{PROJECTFOLDER}/src/logcat_symbolizer.cpp
but
#{PROJECTFOLDER}/example.cpp ->*NOT recommended* <-
